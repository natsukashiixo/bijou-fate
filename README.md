# Requirements

Python => 3.11.0
Pillow => 10.0.1

Most likely more backwards compatible, but only tested on these versions.

# Usage

Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/natsukashiixo/bijou-fate.git`

Just run `python main.py` and enter your options separated by a comma. If you'd for instance would like to ask: Watch Bijou or What do you mean watching someone else than Bijou you'd write: `Watch Bijou, What do you mean watching someone else than Bijou`

# Worth noting

If you decide to hook this into a Discord bot or something similar, you're in charge of your own security. I threw this together in a few hours with no consideration other than getting some hands on Pillow experience.
